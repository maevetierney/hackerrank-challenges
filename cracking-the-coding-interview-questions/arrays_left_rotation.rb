# Problem Title: Arrays: Left Rotation

  #note: found on hackerrank.com but is originally a problem featured in Cracking the Coding Interview.
#########################

# Objective :
  #A left rotation operation on an array of size shifts each of the arrays elements  unit to the left.

  #For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array [1,2,3,4,5] , then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2].

  # Given an array of n integers and a number, d, perform d left rotations on the array.

  # Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.
